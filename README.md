## Das Keyboard 4 controller replacement - usb2 only.

I had a mains accident with my das keyboard, and blew out the USB3 hub, the Via xxxxfixmexx part.  
I sourced a replacement, but it never came up, so perhaps it was more broken.

Today, I've had the idea of just making a replacement controller board for it.  They _keys_ are presumably all still fine.

So... Pick a cheap in stock MCU supported by QMK, just go for a plain USB2-HS hub part, and.. profit?
